* Development
** TODO Consider adding `organism` support.
** TODO Need to support `as.DESeqDataSet` and `as.DESeqTransform` coercion methods.
** TODO plotMA and plotVolcano may need to handle NA gene to symbol mapping better.
** TODO Consider adding method support for: colData, rowData, rowRanges.
** TODO Ensure coercion methods for `as.DESeqDataSet` and `asDESeqTransform` work here.
** TODO Need to think about NA gene symbol handling in call to convertGenesToSymbols.
** TODO `export()`: Need to improve full path messages for "data", "transform", etc...
** TODO `plotContrastScatter`: Need to think about NA gene symbol handling in call to convertGenesToSymbols.
